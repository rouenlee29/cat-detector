## Goal
Use fast.ai to detect one of the follwing cat breeds:

- Domestic Medium Hair
- Persian
- Ragdoll
- Siamese
- Snowshoe

## Files

- `cat_breed_detector-v3.ipynb` : Development of model
- `cat_detector_tools.py` : Helper functions to develop model 
- `development` directory: contains files needed to deploy on Heroku 

I have also written a [blog post](https://www.notion.so/Deep-learning-for-a-cat-I-miss-5a4162ef02e1464992f733d578a61ed6) on this project, which includes: 
- Installation of relevant libraries
- Scraping data
- Model training
- Deployment to Heroku (for free), result can be found [here](https://cat-detector-app.herokuapp.com/).
